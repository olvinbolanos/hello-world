# hello-world
<!*** This repository is about a website platform I made to show a simple blog post out of HTML and CSS
<!*** What I did in this post was use my links to use different fonts from google and plug them in to my web page.  ***>
<!*** I made this website responsive to fit in any mobile app ***>
<!*** The Like buttons are wrapped around a for loop and are interactive with the user !***>
<!*** the email input is responsive and has a required method in HTML that verifies whether the user submitted a verified !**>
<!*** email address, it changes from black to green if its a correct address !***>
<!*** this is just a basic platform one can use to design a simple blogpost and I did not add in the backend !***>
<!*** I have also added in here a couple of files you may be interested in downloading for your own personal use !***>
